# Chill House Utilities
Chill House is a community Discord server, where people talk to each other play games, and enjoy fun events that take place in the server.

# Features
It has many fun, moderation and info commands. This bot has no database requirement. 

# About the bot 
I wanted to give the users a lot more than the existing discord bots in just one bot so, I decided I would make a custom bot that would have all the features of the other bots at one place.
